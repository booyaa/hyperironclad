# hyperironclad

A collection of tools to make docker-ing easier.  These tools are primarily 
to help with maintenance of wordpress sites. Where possible I'll turn into 
generic scripts.

# catalogue

- files.sh - creates a temporary container that allows you to access the 
files in a data container.
- query.sh - fires up a mysql client against your mysql/mariadb container.
- restore.sh - restore script, currently only handles wordpress files. sql 
restore to follow.
